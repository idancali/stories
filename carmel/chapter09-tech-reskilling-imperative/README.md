*The Carmel Way: Redefining Work In The Machine Era*

## Chapter 9: The Tech Reskilling Imperative

There are many low-tech human workers like you out there, holding down jobs that are at risk with the rise of AI machines. Robots are well on their way to replace 30% of UK jobs by the early 2030s and 38% of US jobs, as research by PWC shows in a recent report. Technology is changing the future of work as we know it. Any job that can be automated, will be automated, whether we like it or not. Some, like the Wall Street Journal, go as far as postulating that Every Company Is Now a Tech Company and many other leaders certainly agree. So what does that mean for hundreds of millions of low-tech human workers at risk today? What does this mean for you? 

It means that you have to learn new skills, that will give you new job opportunities in the new rising machine era. It means that you have to get the kind of education that will help you hit the ground running fast and start a new career as soon as humanly possible. A future-proof career. A career not easily replaceable by robots and one that will create ample opportunities for a better future. Hundreds of millions of low-tech human workers like you are becoming increasingly aware that tech reskilling is the only viable solution to securing a better future for themselves and their loved ones. 

In a survey by the Pew Research Center, 54% of US workers say that "it will be essential for them to get training and develop new skills throughout their work life in order to keep up with changes in the workplace." An additional 33% say this will be important. And 64% believe that knowing computer programming is crucial to success in today's economy. Want to survive in a tech world? What options does one have, other than to become technical? In the new tech-dominated era, the best career choice is to transition from a passive tech consumer to an active tech creator. One of those few people who not only survive but thrive in a tech world. And the best way to not only survive but to thrive in the Digital Economy is to become a Software Developer. 

While non-technical jobs will disappear, demand for Software Developers will continue to grow, according to a report by the World Economic Forum, where 350 employers were interviewed. In fact, the 2018 U.S. News & World Best Jobs Report ranks Software Developer as the No. 1 Job overall. But there are currently only 23 million Software Developers worldwide as recently reported by Evans Data, and that number is only predicted to grow to 27.7 million within the next five years, in the same report. 

 In a world demanding more and more technological solutions and in a world where every company is becoming a tech company, can less than 30 million developers keep up with the increasing global demand for digital transformation? The answer is obvious. The Tech-Reskilling imperative is loud and clear. And this is absolutely great news for you and millions of your low-tech peers. Yes, low-tech jobs are going away soon, but a new and exciting universe, that of Software Development, is ripe with opportunity for those willing to embrace the future of work, acquire new skills and are ready to make a living in the Digital Economy. 

### A Fresh New Look At Tech Education 

Given the imperative to reskill hundreds of millions of low-tech workers, can we, as a society, do it? Can we reskill 1 billion low-tech workers? Can we offer everyone a fair chance, a fair opportunity at a good future in a machine era? Are we ready to take on this incredible opportunity? Or are we going to leave you and many others like you behind as we move towards a machine-dominated marketplace? 

Unfortunately, things are not looking too good for you at the moment, my friend. The evidence that current formal Computer Science programs are not producing enough graduates, is overwhelming. Alternative Tech Education solutions such as bootcamps and online video learning are compensating, but the numbers simply don’t add up. 

Considering that we’re only looking at roughly 23 million developers today, as per the Evans Data 2018 report, reskilling hundreds of millions of workers seems practically impossible. Even if we were to consider more optimistic estimates, say somewhere around 35 or even 40 million, we’re still facing a monumental task. The traditional model is centered around the concept of lectures. Whether delivered in person in a classroom setting or using video in an online environment, lectures are the primary pedagogical educational method used today. But lectures are not the most effective way of teaching especially when it comes to teaching technology. In Teaching in the Digital Age, Bates demonstrates that “lectures are ineffective when it comes to supporting critical components of learning, such as developing critical thinking skills, applying knowledge, and fostering deep understanding.” 

Picking up on Bates’ research on Lectures, a joint research project from MIT and the Humboldt Institute goes further and questions not only the effectiveness of lectures but the effectiveness of video lectures as well, by stating that “with little conclusive research to show that video is indeed an effective method for learning, it seems problematic that online learning pedagogy is concentrated so heavily in this medium.” 

What got us here, will simply not get us to where we want to be in the near and long term future. Tech Education is difficult and it’s absolutely clear that we, as a society, are more than struggling to produce new Software Developers. If we can’t come up with a way to scale Tech Education, we’re literally leaving most of the human workforce behind. So what will it really take to reskill hundreds of millions of low-tech workers, like you? What will it take to scale Tech Education? Nothing short of a miracle. 

But if there is a way to scale, all evidence points to the fact that we need to redefine the traditional Tech Education Model. We need a new approach to teaching people how to code. A way that not only works but a way that scales, and a way that goes beyond lectures and videos. The miracle would have to be nothing short of a better way of teaching Software Development. A new, scalable Tech Educational Model. 

### Introducing Tweak-N-Learn™ 

The way Software Development is taught today to new, aspiring developers, is completely opposite to the way professional developers actually learn and grow their technical skills. The traditional computer science college degree, the coding bootcamps or online video courses take a theory-first approach to teaching. Students are taught concepts such as conditional statements, variables, loops, classes, objects and so on. 

Eventually, the student is introduced to simulated environments or sample projects where they can see the theoretical concepts in action. It can take weeks or even months before a student is ready to tackle real world projects. No wonder we can’t scale fast enough. Even then, the projects are generally simple in nature and not very useful in a real world scenario. 

The professional developer, on the other hand, starts with real world projects, typically for a client in an agency or for their employer. When the need for new functionality arises, the professional developer begins a learning and discovery process, wildly different than the traditional learning process of a novice. The professional developer taps into their personal peer network and asks for advice and searches online on development forums, where other developers hang out and share knowledge. When a solution arises, they tweak and tweak again, until they learn enough about the problem and then they continue tweaking and learning until the problem is solved. 

Carmel offers novice developers a new Tech Educational Model to acquire and grow their technical skills, similar to that found in a professional development environment. We call this model, Tweak-N-Learn™ and we have found a way to encapsulate it into an intuitive Developer Experience simple enough for brand new developers and complex enough to be useful and valuable to intermediate and even advanced developers. In the Carmel Tweak-N-Learn™ Developer Experience, a novice learner, like you, starts out with a product template and then makes small tweaks to that template as he completes small microlearning programming puzzles, called Challenges. In the process, the learner acquires skills by completing the Challenges and creates real world value by writing real code that can be published online and shared with the world, directly from Carmel. 

With Carmel and our unique Tweak-N-Learn™ Tech Educational Model, a new learner like you, can simply login to their Carmel Workspace available and start their Developer Journey instantly. Then you can choose a Challenge from the many available on the platform, and following the instructions carefully, you can start tweaking your newly created product, slowly, but surely. As you tweak, you earns skills and see your changes taking effect live, in a real professional Software Development Environment. 

Once you completes you first Challenge, you earn Experience Points and unlock Achievements that you can proudly display on your Carmel Profile. You can also publish your newly created and customized product, and share it with the world. This only takes minutes, from logging in to you Carmel Workspace, to acquiring valuable new skills and publishing a brand new website. In the process, you learn but you also create real-world value, in a real-world development environment. 

The reason why implementing Tweak-N-Learn™ is very hard is because the Learner has to work within a real-world environment that abstracts the nitty gritty of the Software Development Life Cycle. This is extremely difficult to accomplish. At best, one of two solutions are generally attempted. 

The first is an environment where the Learner drags-and-drops widgets onto a page and the environment spits out a real product. This is what happens in most DIY website or app builders and the effect is that the product is indeed launched but the Learner has not acquired any real technical skills. So it is productive, but not educational. 

The second approach is clearly seen in traditional programming courses where the Learner acquires significant knowledge about the technology but not nearly enough hands-on practice. The result is that at the end of the course, video or in-person, the Learner is ill equipped to produce real-world value. So it is educational, but not productive. 

The Carmel Tweak-N-Learn™ model is unique in the sense that it is both educational and productive. With every completed Carmel Challenge, you not only acquire new technical skills but at the exact same time, you also produce real value by creating new real world features. Carmel literally bridges the gap between education and productivity. 

And that, is simply groundbreaking. 

### The Carmel Tweak-N-Learn™ Principles 

One of the major drawbacks of most available online education is that much too often it's merely an extension of the traditional classroom. In a typical online video learning model, which dominates the current tech educational system, the teacher lectures the student via video, much like a traditional teacher would lecture students in a college classroom. 

But in the real world, at the office, software developers learn in a much more direct and hands-on way. They are rarely lectured and are much more self-directed. The knowledge is shared from peer to peer and the learning experience is highly personal and self-determined. The content is also broken down into much smaller pieces than a typical lecture and it's usually very specific to a problem to be solved. 

Carmel is designed from scratch to implement an Educational Model that is based on solid principles collected from real-world experiences working in the Software Industry. It is a radical departure from the typical video-based lecture model and it is aimed at creating a learning experience much closer to how professional software developers learn on an ongoing basis, rather than mirroring how computer science is taught in a traditional college setting. With Carmel, developers engage in a hands on, microlearning model that is self-directed, peer driven and story-based. 

*Hands On*

Learning with Carmel, the Learner is exposed to a way of doing things that feels very real. As real as if they were in an office, working on a real-world problem for a real-world product. The Carmel Learning Experience ensures that every Carmel Learner gets their hands dirty doing real work. At the end of the work assignment, the student learned something but also created something new and so they gain not only raw knowledge about a concept but also new skills and put them in practice right away. That is the real power of the Tweak-N-Learn™ model. 

*Microlearning*

The hands on learning assignments are designed to be small enough to be undertaken in a few minutes of spare time. Each assignment is called a Challenge and it provides an opportunity to learn a small and specific skill about solving one problem. This is exactly how real world tech learning happens in a learning environment where software developers thrive and are continuously improving their skills. 

*Self-Directed*

Carmel Learners design their own learning path by choosing which Carmel Challenge to undertake next and when. A Carmel Learning Path is very personal, in that given enough Challenges, no two paths will be similar and no two paths will be undertaken the same way by two different students. One might take longer to complete a challenge and they might complete it in a different way or a different style. At the end of the day, the result will be a unique and Personal Learning Journey that clearly outlines what the student knows and how well they know the concepts they've learned. 

*Peer Driven*

The Carmel Community is comprised of Software Developers who are at different levels in their Developer Journey. Carmel enables each community memr to contribute knowledge back into the community in the form of Carmel Challenges based on personal experience. Someone who has solved a problem in a certain way in the past has the relevant knowledge and skills to challenge someone else to acquire that same knowledge and develop those same skills. The more a student learns, the more they can give back and also become a teacher to others. 

*Story-Based*

Every Carmel Developer is encouraged to keep a Developer Journal that actively documents their Learning Journey. Each developer has their own story and others can participate in that story by connecting, conversing and engaging as their own story develops. Carmel generates story elements based on challenges which the developer either authored or completed and there is also a measure of progress that shows how much the developer knows and what it is that they can do as a software developer.
