*The Carmel Way: Redefining Work In The Machine Era*

## Preface

It's 3:02 AM.

You wake up in a cold sweat.

Again.

You can't sleep. Again.

The thought of it all is eating you up inside. It's keeping you up at night and it's getting worse. You remember that viral video of that robot that does backflips. Then the one about that surgeon robot that can sew a grape skin with inhuman precision. And then it all comes back. The thought of those robots replacing millions of jobs, including your own.

You love your job and you're good at it. But it's one of those low-tech jobs that is at risk of being automated and replaced by cheaper, more performant, intelligent machines. 

You walk over to your kitchen and pour yourself a glass of water.

The children are sound asleep. Peacefully dreaming of sweet nothings, the kind only children can dream.

What if?

What if you do lose your job one day? What would you do? What could you do? How would you provide for your loved ones? And what kind of world would your little ones grow up to experience? 

A machine world?

You know deep down in your gut, that your family and millions of other families across this round world of ours - are all at risk. You gulp that lonely glass of water, in that dimly lit kitchen and slowly tip toe your way back to bed. 

Tomorrow is another day. Maybe you're wrong. Maybe there's nothing to worry about.

Unfortunately, there is, my friend. Studies show that hundreds of millions of jobs are at risk in the next decade and a half. It's not science fiction anymore. Artificial Intelligence has grown in leaps and bounds and we can now expect intelligent robots to enter the workforce - en masse. Every human task that can be automated, will be automated. 

And absolutely every low-tech job is at risk. 

You have sound reasons to worry. Whether we want to admit it or not, the Machine Era is here and it's here to stay. 

But hey, cheer up. There's good news. There is a plethora of jobs that will come with this global transition to the Digital Economy. In fact, every business is demanding Digital Innovation Solutions - as in yesterday. If businesses lack an online presence, a mobile app and an overall digital strategy, they're in trouble. And they know it. The demand for quality high tech work is skyrocketing. Even as demand for low-tech jobs is declining. 

I hear you. Software Development is for those young Silicon Valley kids. You're in your forties. You've got kids. A mortgage. And a sore lower back that gets horribly stiff when it rains. Or maybe you’re a newly landed immigrant trying to make ends meet, with no discretionary time for learning anything new. I hear you. And yet - listen to me. If we stand any chance whatsoever, even a tiny hope, of living in a human-centered world, in the near and distant future - then we can't do it without you. Listen to me carefully. 

The Machine Era will keep marching on – with or without our consent. But if you, me, your children, my children, and the rest of humanity stand any chance of inhabiting a world that is human friendly and worth enjoying, we have to get our act together and start becoming Tech Builders, and not just Tech Consumers. If you have an online account, you use technology. If you send emails, you use technology. If you read news online, you use technology. We all use technology. But how many of us really create technology? How many of us build? 

I'll tell you how many. Less than 30 million of us. That's how many. That's how many Software Developers open their laptops every day and build software. Versus billions of other human beings on this planet who use the software the rest of us build. The only way we stand a chance to get some sleep at night in this brave new world, especially you, my low-tech worker friend, is if we have, not 30 million, not 300 million, but a billion Software Developers out there. People like you and me who boss machines around and command them to act in our interests. People like you and me who tap into our authentic human intelligence to create human-centric Software Products that make our world more human. More worthy of our children and our children's children to enjoy.

Can anyone learn to code? Can anyone actually become a Software Developer? No, not even close. But the ones that want it badly enough - can. And here's the fun part. If you are willing to embark on this insane journey of becoming a Software Developer, here's my promise to you. Not only will you be able to finally get some sleep at night and stop worrying, but you will get to meet others like yourself on this journey. 

We're building a movement and we're calling it Carmel. 

A movement of committed people like you who are willing to level up their skills and become tech creators, builders, makers. 

And I, and many others like me, will be there to cheer you along, to support you and to do whatever it takes to help you make it. And you will. If you want it, you will make it. You will get hired as a Software Developer. And you will build amazing products that the rest of the world will love to use. 

This book is my gift to you as you begin this journey. I will share my personal Developer Journey with you. And I will open up my entire heart and my whole mind in the pages that follow with one single purpose. One single purpose. For you to decide, truly decide, before you reach the last page, that you will do this. That you will commit to this. And that nothing will stop you until you start your new career as a brand new Software Developer. 

I promise you this. If you make that commitment to yourself - the commitment to learn - I will meet you halfway and I promise you on behalf of the entire Carmel Community that we will all pitch in, our energy, our knowledge and our time, to support you - start to finish. 

And beyond.

Come.

We've got a long journey ahead of us. But one that will be worth every single minute you spend learning. It's time to flip the page in
your career. 

Let's do this.
