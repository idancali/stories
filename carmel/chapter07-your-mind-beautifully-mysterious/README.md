*The Carmel Way: Redefining Work In The Machine Era*

## Chapter 7: Your Mind Is Beautifully Mysterious

The robots are coming. 

We’ve heard that for decades now. 

Remember that masterpiece called “Modern Times”? The 1930’s Charlie Chaplin film? About him working in a factory?  

It’s pure genius. 

The part where he is being force-fed by a seemingly intelligent “feeding machine” is authentic Chaplin comedy. What I love about Chaplin’s comedy is the fact that it’s more than just comedy. He didn’t do what he did just to make us laugh. I love that about his art. He did what he did to make us think. Even many – many decades later. To him, comedy wasn’t an end in itself - it was a means.  

A means to start a philosophical, silent, mental contemplation of a deep reality. 

I love that. I love works of art, like Chaplin’s films, that transcend the medium and the obvious and bring the audience somewhere beyond that obvious. Somewhere else.  

Watching Chaplin’s character in “Modern Times” being robbed of his human dignity, piece by piece, by a soulless machine – makes you wonder. Makes your mind go to a certain place, somewhere, in a potential future - and it makes you ask certain questions. 

Where are we headed?  

Was Chaplin just ridiculous? 

Are machines out to rob us of our human dignity? 

Nah. That’s crazy. 

Or … 

### The Human-Machine Relationship Is Centuries Old 

Before we peak into the future, let’s remember our relationship with machines for a minute. 

It all started with the original noble intent of improving our lives.  

Our lives, as in our lives as human beings. 

With the invention of the steam engine – certainly before then too – but around that time, with the revolutionary machine that took the 17th century by storm, the world entered a new period of technological advance, never before seen in the history of humanity. Manual work, all kinds of manual work, suddenly become replaceable by machine work.  

And so, humanity embarked on a long and never-ending journey of continuous technological improvement. 

By the 18th century, steam power had ushered in the Industrial Revolution and well into the 19th century, a plethora of machines began taking their rightful place in history – and on the assembly line. Every aspect of our human lives become industrialized. Starting with agriculture but moving on to transportation, construction, mining, food, healthcare and of course manufacturing. All areas of life were permeated by machines. The smartest machines around.  

Production soared. 

And the standard of life soared too. Working men and women started to form a new middle class of industrialists as fresh opportunities for employment soared. If you wanted to make something of yourself and provide a better future for your family, now you had the opportunity to do so. Machines made it possible for manual workers to speed up production and lower manufacturing costs. 

Here was a new era upon humankind, an era of increased wellbeing where men and women began using machines like never before, to improve the human condition. 

### Maybe Chaplin Was Unto Something After All 

But, somewhere during the 20th century, we started to get anxious. 

Watching Chaplin being force-fed by a lifeless metal overlord foreshadowed a now ominously real “us vs them” scenario. 

During the astronomical economic and technical progress of the 20th century we somehow got to a point where we started fearing machines. 

Pure fear. 

“What if they take over?” 

“What if they will bring upon the extinction of humanity?” 

We wonder. And ponder. And we question. 

“Can they do that?” 

Oh yes. Yes, they can. 

It’s simple really. The more work we pushed machines to do for us over time, the more intelligent we had to make them.  

And so, Artificial Intelligence was born. 

Modern AI systems are so intelligent and even emotional, that they could literally smirk, laugh or even cry at their industrial ancestors.  

As AI keeps getting smarter and more capable, we’re rapidly moving from Chaplin’s fictional “feeding machine” to advanced artificial “life forms”.  

AI machines today can do things that humans can’t even dream of attempting. 

They can memorize more information than we can. 

They can run faster than us. 

They don’t need sleep. 

They don’t need food. 

They can speak more languages than us. 

They can sing. 

They can paint. 

They can write. 

They can direct movies. 

They can drive for us. Feed us. Clothe us. They can live on us, on our clothes, on our wrists, in our pockets.  

They can even live inside our bodies. 

Think this is fiction? No, all this and more – much more, is happening today. Machines can do almost every single thing humans can.  

But better. 

Soon, they will be able to argue cases in court. And soon they will be able to police us. Maybe judge us. Maybe even lead us.  

Or ... rule us? 

How long before machines get to vote? 

How long before machines elect their own as managers, CEOs, mayors and presidents? 

### Your Next Boss Might Not Be Human 

We’re actively debating now whether we can speak of AI machines as having a life of their own. 

After all, they can walk, talk, work, think and even feel. 

In our rising Machine World, we are starting to speak of machines not so much as systems but we are beginning to think of them as organisms. 

Living organisms, maybe? 

There are some who even speak of taxing AI machines.  

Imagine a robot as a decent, tax payer, minding its own business, going to work and contributing to the economy. Making friends. Having conversations. Making memories. Feeling lonely. Feeling sad. Feeling happy. 

Feeling angry. 

Now imagine yourself, working for such a robot. 

As we kick off the third decade of the 21st century, we’re entering a period of AI improvements that will shock and amaze us when the technology goes mainstream and becomes commercial. 

Soon, humans will employ robots. 

Just like they will employ human workers, businesses will also employ intelligent machines. Initially, the robots will not earn wages, but they will act more like slaves who will work for their human masters day and night, without demanding anything in return. 

A business will either rent or purchase a robot, much like they purchase other machines today. 

But as we continue to improve artificial intelligence, the AI machines will quickly evolve into entities that will have their own democratic rights and they will enjoy more and more liberties. 

Artificial citizens?

Artificial … people? 

Free – autonomous, artificially intelligent "persons", earning wages for themselves and using those wages to purchase goods and services that align with their "personal" interests. 

### Machines Will Care For Machines First And Foremost 

It doesn’t take a genius to draw the obvious conclusion that as machines will increase in intelligence, they will care more and more about themselves – and less and less about their human overlords. 

AI machines are extremely close to becoming free citizens, subject to the state but free, as free as any of us humans. And we will have to respect their rights – much like they will have to respect our rights. Hopefully. 

But this is where it gets hairy. 

What rights? 

We have human rights. Because we’re human. 

Do we give machines human rights? 

At first, probably. 

But what’s stopping them in creating their own rights. Machine rights. And what’s stopping them from recording and communicating those rights in a language that we humans would not be able to decrypt. 

And what’s stopping them from pursuing those rights according to their own – intelligent – beliefs. According to their own laws. Machine laws. 

The answer is, probably nothing. 

How will we stop them from caring about themselves first – about their own machine race? 

That’s a question we – as a human family – need to answer.  

Quickly. 

### The Space Answer 

One solution would be to just call it quits with our planet altogether and run off into space. Mars probably. And start building a new world. From scratch. 

Hopefully, soon, before the AI machines are smart and sentient enough to decide to follow us there. 

Intergalactic wars anyone? 

Who knows. 

But what we do know – now – is that we can’t ignore what’s coming. What we do know is that AI machines are getting too intelligent, too fast. 

For some it’s not fast enough. 

For others, it’s too late to do anything about it. And so, they took all their resources and invested them in space travel. 

We’ll get there. We probably will get there. Who knows. Maybe we could start from scratch on another planet and even live to tell our great grandkids about the “old planet” we come from. 

I’m not saying that’s not possible. 

What I’m saying is that I think we have a responsibility to this planet. 

### The Other Scenario 

What about those of us stubborn enough to envision a human-centered future? 

Right here on Earth.  

Is that possible? Can we outrun the robots of the near future? Can we outwork them?  

Do we stand any chance whatsoever of competing with artificial intelligence? 

The answer lies deep into the beautiful mystery of the human mind. 

The way a human mind works is still widely speculative. We can infer some facts based on our observations so far, but overall, we don’t really know what the human mind does and how it does it. 

Here’s what we know though. 

We know that human intelligence is two-fold. Since Raymond Cattell first introduced the concept of a two-fold human intelligence in the 1960’s, it has become an undisputed fact in psychology and almost taken for granted now. 

The two dimensions of human intelligence are Fluid Intelligence and Crystallized Intelligence. 

Fluid Intelligence allows us to recognize patterns, reason and make decisions without any prior knowledge. Essentially, the ability to think flexibly, the ability to use our mind to solve problems we have not encountered before and to make sense of new environments and new situations. 

Whereas Crystallized Intelligence is our ability to acquire knowledge and recall that knowledge when we need it.  

When we speak of Artificial Intelligence, it’s all Crystallized Intelligence. It’s based on data we feed the machines. AI training only happens when the AI models are fed a lot of data to process and then they get “smarter.” No data, no AI. 

So yes, when it comes to Crystallized Intelligence, we stand no chance. AI Machines have better memories and faster access to information.  

But, Fluid Intelligence – well that’s a completely different matter. 

And this is where humanity stands a chance. 

Your mind, is capable of so much more than regurgitating knowledge on demand – like a machine. Your mind is beautiful. And mysterious. And powerful. All we have to do is learn how to tap into our own Fluid Intelligence and strengthen our ability to reason in a way that is and always will be foreign to machines. 

### The 3-Step Master Plan Towards a More Human World 

Human beings are more valuable than machines. H > m. That’s what I believe wholeheartedly. But it’s not enough to simply rejoice at being more valuable. We have to act intentionally if our children’s children are to live in a human-centered world. 

I see 3 key steps we need to undergo as a human family to ensure a better world for ourselves, our loved ones and for future generations – of humans. 

*Step 1*

First, we have to Learn How Machines Think. 

When we speak about intelligent machines, what we really mean to say is “here’s a machine that thinks like a human”. That’s how we got them to be so smart – by teaching them how we humans think. If they can do what we do – and better – it's because we humans trained and are still training machines to think and act like us. It’s about time for us to start getting serious about learning how they think too. 

That’s the business of Software Development. A Software Developer’s job is to literally get into the mind of the computer so to speak and even more – tell it what to think and what to do. I call Software Development, “bossing machines around”. And it’s true. As a Software Developer you literally program the machine – you tell it what you want it to do. You give it instructions. Commands. You command it. 

We only have less than 30 million “machine commanders” - Software Development - in the world right now. And we’re looking at billions of machines that are multiplying so much faster than us and are growing in intelligence at alarming rates. We need more Software Developers. 

The world needs more Software Developers. 

We need more people who understand these machines and have a word to say in their development. 

*Step 2*

Secondly, we need to tap into our Fluid Intelligence.

Even if we start getting to know machines well enough, we can’t compete with them. In fact, the more you know about them, the more you advance in your Software Development journey, the more you realize we stand no chance at competing with them head on. 

We need a creative strategy. We need to tap into our fluid reasoning which machines are utterly incapable of developing. We need to do what we have always done as humans and start getting comfortable in uncomfortable situations. We need to start doing things we thought we could not do before. That’s how we tap into our fluid intelligence. We need to step out of the things we’ve always done – out of our comfort zone. To tap into that kind of a mindset is our only way of staying different. It’s our unique value proposition so to speak in the “us vs machines” scenario. Think about it. We can make decisions without prior knowledge. They can’t. We need to learn to use this power of fluid reasoning and use it now. 

This, coupled with our technical knowledge – step 1 of the Master Plan – will position us to build machines that serve us and machines that work for us. We will be positioned to build Software Products that truly make this world a more human place for all of us. Even if the world will end up being dominated my machines – and it will – if we tap into our Fluid Intelligence and learn the skills we need to build new technology, we stand a chance of carving a future for humanity in a machine world. A Human-Centered Machine Era.

*Step 3* 

And third – the most important key aspect in all of this is the fact that we need to do it together. We have to unite and work together. Our collaboration towards the same noble goal of providing a better future for ourselves, for our families and for future generations – is the ultimate key. Carmel is at its core, a human community of Software Developers on a mission to contributing to a Human-Centered future.

We’ve built Carmel as the embodiment of this masterplan. 

We need you to keep going and we need you to get involved if you believe H > m and if you believe a word of all of this. 

So unless you're looking forward to being force-fed by your next machine overlord, like in Chaplin' film - we gotta start getting serious about to something and do it now.

Let’s learn to build technology. Human-centered technology.

Let’s learn to tap into our Fluid Intelligence and uncover the mysterious beauty of the human brain. 

And let’s do it together.

Who's in?
